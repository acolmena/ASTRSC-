Through research, the ASTRSC team has discovered that [this website](https://describeweb.com/describing-words-describe-nature/) contains most of the words ASTRSC should flag. However, this website contains over 600 words not all of which are relevant in the ASTRSC context. Hence, we will scrape this website and only choose the relevant words.\n",
