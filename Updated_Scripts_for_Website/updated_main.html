      Do you really mean the whole entire continent? Africa is often treated as
      a country, and Africans depicted as a monolith! If it's relevant, try to
      be more specific.

    <aside id="tribalism">
      African issues are often reduced to matters of ethnicity and tribal
      rivalries, even when that is an incomplete or inaccurate picture. African
      communities and groups are often described as tribes regardless of social
      organization, when similar groups would be described as nations, minority
      groups, or communities elsewhere in the world. The framing of conflicts as
      driven by tribal hatred is particularly harmful and can contribute to
      conflict escalation.

    <aside id="nature">
      People love to describe the savanna, the jungles, the wildlife, and the
      vast empty lands of Africa. Fascinating and thrilling as they are,
      descriptions of African nature and wildlife should be used carefully.
      Africa has long been portrayed as an unadulterated natural reservation; a
      big virgin jungle to tame and explore. If it is not directly related to
      your subject matter, spare your readers the romanticized natural
      descriptions.

      <span style="font-weight: 400"
        >To this day, Africa is seen as a place ridden with conflict, violence,
        and devastation. While crises continue to unfold in certain regions of
        the continent, the language used to describe them is often particularly
        bleak and fatalistic. As the 'Dark Continent' stereotype continues to be
        one of the most harmful ones to Africa's image, it is worth
        interrogating whether we are seeing the continent through too negative
        and alarmist a lens.</span
